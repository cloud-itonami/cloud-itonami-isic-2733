  "Pure-function domain logic for the ISIC 2733 (wiring devices) plant-
  operations coordination actor -- equipment/batch verification,
  shipment-quantity recompute, product-type validation, contact-
  resistance plausibility validation, defect-rate plausibility
  validation, and draft maintenance-schedule/shipment-coordination
  record construction.

  Per docs/adr/0001-architecture.md Decision 1: this vertical has NO
  pre-existing `kotoba-lang/wiringdevmfg`-style capability library to
  wrap (verified: no such repo exists). The domain logic therefore
  lives here as pure functions, re-verified INDEPENDENTLY by
  `wiringdevmfg.governor` -- the same 'ground truth, not self-report'
  discipline every sibling actor's own registry establishes (e.g.
  `otherelecmfg.registry/shipment-quantity-exceeded?` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2790`, and `elecequipmfg.registry` from
  `cloud-itonami-isic-2710`): never trust a proposal's own
  self-reported quantity/status when the inputs needed to recompute it
  independently are already on record.

  This namespace is pure data + pure functions -- no I/O, no network
  call to any real plant-operations system. It builds the DRAFT record
  a plant coordinator would keep (a scheduled maintenance window, a
  coordinated shipment), not the act of actuating molding/assembly/
  test-line equipment or dispatching a real freight carrier, and never
  the act of issuing an electrical-safety certification mark (this
  actor NEVER does any of those -- see README `What this actor does
  NOT do`).

  SCOPE: ISIC 2733 is manufacture of wiring devices -- switches,
  socket-outlets, plugs, and junction boxes (distinct from sibling
  ISIC 2732's wires and cables). The manufacturing plant molds device
  housings (thermoplastic/thermoset), assembles contacts/terminals/
  screws, and runs end-of-line test lines (including contact-
  resistance and dielectric-withstand testing) producing finished
  units of these product families. This actor coordinates the
  back-office record-keeping around that plant (production-batch
  logging, maintenance scheduling, safety-concern flagging, shipment
  coordination) -- it never touches the molding/assembly/test-line
  equipment directly, and it never stands in for the certification
  body that issues electrical-safety compliance marks (e.g.
  UL/CE/IEC).")
